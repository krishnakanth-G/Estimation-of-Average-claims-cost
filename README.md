# Estimation of Average claims cost

The aim of the project is to estimate the claim cost for automobile crashes. Main work consists of the following,
1. Development of framework to estimate average claims cost for automobile crashes using Machine learning learning techniques.
2. Implementation of Generalized linear models with suitable distribution and Artificial
neural network that fits the automobile crashes data.
3. comparative study between the relevant models.
4. Interpreting models with Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations.
